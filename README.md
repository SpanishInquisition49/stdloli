Contributions are made to this repo via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). <br/> A few general guidelines that cover both:

* Search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.

### Issues

Issues should be used to report problems with the library, request a new feature, or to discuss potential changes before a PR is created.

If you find an Issue that addresses the problem you're having, please add your own reproduction information to the existing issue rather than creating a new one.

### Pull Requests

PRs are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement slated. In general, PRs should:

- Only fix/add the functionality in question **OR** address wide-spread whitespace/style issues, not both.
- Add unit or integration tests for fixed or changed functionality (if a test suite already exists).
- Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible.
